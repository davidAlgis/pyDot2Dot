## Usage

Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.6 or newer installed on your system. Then you can simply launch the application with `dot_2_dot.exe`.

## Details about Parameters

### Two Ways to Change Sizes

1. **Using Pixel Values for Radius and Font Size:**

   ```
   Radius 10
   ```

   In this example, the radius of the dots will be 10 pixels, and the font size for labels will be 15 pixels.

2. **Using Percentages for Radius and Font Size:**

   ```
   Font Size 2%
   ```

   In this example, the radius of the dots will be 5% of the diagonal of the image, and the font size will be 2% of the diagonal.

### Using Both Distance and Number of Points

You can combine the `distance` and `numPoints` parameters to control both the number of dots and their spacing.

```
Number of Points 100 
Distance Min 5%
Distance Max 10%
```

This will first simplify the path to around 100 points and then adjust the placement of dots so that the distance between them is between 5% and 10% of the diagonal length.

### More about the Placement of the Dots

The placement of the dots is controlled by the `Shape Detection` argument, which determines the method used to detect shapes in the image. There are two methods available:

- **Contour Method (`Shape Detection Contour`)**: This method detects the contours in the image using OpenCV's contour detection algorithms. It approximates the contours of shapes in the image and places dots along these contours. This method is suitable for images with "closed" shapes. A closed shape has an endpoint that connects back to its beginning, such as this one:

  ![Contour Shape](assets/figure_contour.jpeg)

- **Path Method (`Shape Detection Path`)**: This method uses skeletonization to extract the central path or skeleton of the largest shape in the image. It is useful for images with shapes that are "open," where the shape starts and ends at different points, like this one:

  ![Path Shape](assets/figure_path.jpeg)

### More about the Number of Dots

The number of dots placed along the paths is influenced by several parameters that control the simplification and spacing of the points:

- **Epsilon**: This parameter controls the approximation accuracy for contour simplification. A smaller epsilon value results in a higher number of points (more detailed contours), while a larger epsilon value reduces the number of points by simplifying the contours more aggressively. Lowering the epsilon value increases the number of dots, capturing finer details of the shape.

- **Distance Min and Max**: These values set the minimum and maximum distances between points as percentages of the image diagonal. The script enforces these distance constraints after simplifying the path. Points closer than the minimum distance will be removed, and midpoints will be inserted between points that are farther apart than the maximum distance. The distance parameters have priority over the desired number of points (`Number of Points`).

- **Desired Number of Points**: This parameter specifies the desired number of points in the simplified path. The script will first attempt to simplify the path to approximately this number of points using the Visvalingamâ€“Whyatt algorithm.


## Command Line Usage (Advanced)

For advanced usage, you can use the application through the command line.

### Installation

Before running the script, make sure to install the required Python libraries. You can install them using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or newer installed on your system. Clone this repository or download the scripts and `requirements.txt` file. Install the required libraries as mentioned above. To use the script, run it from the command line with the desired options:

```
python main.py [options]
```

By default, it launches the GUI windows like the example above, but you can apply the computation only with command line arguments and no graphics.

### Options

- `-g`, `--gui`: Open the GUI or use the console mode. Defaults to `True`.

- `-i`, `--input` `<image>`: Specify the input image path or a folder of images to process. Defaults to `input.png`. If a folder is provided, all images inside will be processed.

- `-o`, `--output` `<image path>`: Specify the output image path or folder. If not provided, the input name with `_dotted` will be used.

- `-sd`, `--shapeDetection` `<method>`: Shape detection method to use. Choose between `"Contour"` or `"Path"`. Defaults to `"Contour"`.

- `-d`, `--distance` `<min> <max>`: Minimum and maximum distances between points. You can provide the values in pixels or as percentages of the image diagonal. For example, `-d 20 50` specifies a minimum distance of 20 pixels and a maximum of 50 pixels, while `-d 5% 10%` specifies distances as percentages of the image diagonal. Has no default value, therefore points could overlap each other by default.
